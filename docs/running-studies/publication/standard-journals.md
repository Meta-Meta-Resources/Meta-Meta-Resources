Almost every journals falls under this category. You may search for journals by topic, or you may want to know about a journal's preprint policies. The following databases each fill a different role. Also see [the page on pre-registrations](/running-studies/preparation/reg-reports-journals) for journals that are pre-registration-compatible.

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
|[PsychInfo catalogue](https://www.apa.org/pubs/databases/psycinfo/coverage) | Probably the most thorough, psychology-specific list of journals |
|[Cognitive Neuroscience Journals and What They Charge You](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E67ONXzXib5i6JeR9ushlE5VL8NtA4vHnomubs64I1M/edit?rm=minimal#gid=0) | A Google doc that is limited in scope but quite detailed for the journals it covers |
|[Brady Lab Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience Journal List Wiki](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/journal) | A sortable wiki with Psychology and Cog. Neuro. journals, impact factors, publishers and open access charges/policies |
| [Web of Science Master Journal List](https://mjl.clarivate.com/search-results) | An easy-to-browse and flexible database of almost every journal in the world; probably the best out of all these resources, but its subsection on psychology is smaller than PsychInfo's and its open access list smaller than the Directory of Open Access Journals |
| [Electronic Journals Library Database](http://rzblx1.uni-regensburg.de/ezeit/about.phtml?lang=en) | Another database of almost every journal, presumably rounds out some of the gaps in the Web of Science list and includes more journals in its psychology section |
[Transpose](https://transpose-publishing.github.io) | Another journal that is limited in its scope, but in this case is extremely detailed about peer review, co-reviewing, and preprinting policies
[Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org) | The most thorough directory of open access journals |
